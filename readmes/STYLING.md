# Font Sizing with Rem Units

## REM
This means that 1rem equals the font size of the html element (which for most browsers has a default value of 16px).

### In tailwind

One spacing unit is equal to 0.25rem, which translates to 4px by default in common browsers.

| Name     |      Size     |  Pixels |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
|0.5        |0.125rem      |2px
|1	        |0.25rem       |4px
|4 (mt-4)	  |1 rem         |16px (margin-top:16px)
